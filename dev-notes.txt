1. In order to check the app within mobile devices add to "vite.config.js" within 
"export default defineConfig({})" these lines:
server: {
    host: true  
}
and then head to http://IPv4:PortNumber

2. In order to create developer documentations create "jsdoc.json" file (you can modify the lines):
{
    "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"],
    "source": {
        "include": ["src"],
        "exclude": ["node_modules", "cypress"],
        "includePattern": ".+\\.js(doc|x)?$"
    },
    "opts": {
        "template": "node_modules/docdash",
        "destination": "./documentation"
    },
    "docdash": {
	"sort": true,
	"search": true,
	"collapse": false
    }
}
Then make sure that JSDoc is installed: npm install -g jsdoc
Choose any theme for your doc (docdash, minami, etc.) and install: npm install docdash --save-dev
Set your "jsdoc.json" file accordingly (depending on the theme)
Run: jsdoc -c jsdoc.json

3. In order to test your app with Cypress follow:
npm run dev (the server has to be up)
"npm install cypress --save-dev" to install Cypress locally as a dev dependency
"npx cypress open" to eXecute Cypress window
